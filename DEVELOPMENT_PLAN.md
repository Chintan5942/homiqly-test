# Homiqly Employee Management System - Development Plan

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates (~20,000 tokens)

### Current Database Analysis
Based on the provided SQL file, I can see:
- `company_employees` table already exists with basic structure
- `service_booking` table has `assigned_employee_id` field (already implemented!)
- Vendor-employee relationship is established via `vendor_id` in `company_employees`

### Required Schema Updates
1. **Add password field to company_employees** (if not exists)
2. **Add employee authentication status fields**
3. **Add employee role and permissions**
4. **Create employee_tasks table for task management**
5. **Update booking status enum for better workflow**

## Phase 2: Backend API Development (~80,000 tokens)

### Employee Authentication System
- Employee login/logout endpoints
- JWT token generation for employees
- Password hashing and security
- Role-based access control

### Employee Management APIs
- CRUD operations for employees (company vendors)
- Employee-booking assignment
- Employee task management
- Employee status updates

### Enhanced Booking System
- Employee assignment to bookings
- Status workflow management (pending → assigned → in_progress → completed)
- Employee-specific booking queries
- Booking history and filtering

### Admin Panel APIs
- Employee assignment interface
- Vendor type checking
- Enhanced booking management with employee data
- Filtering and search capabilities

## Phase 3: Frontend Components (~60,000 tokens)

### Admin Panel Enhancements
- Employee assignment modal
- Vendor type conditional logic
- Enhanced booking management interface
- Employee filtering and search

### Vendor Panel Updates
- Company employee management dashboard
- Employee assignment interface
- Employee performance tracking
- Booking delegation system

### Employee Panel (New)
- Employee authentication pages
- Assigned bookings dashboard
- Task management interface
- Status update controls
- Work history and performance

## Phase 4: Testing & Integration (~30,000 tokens)
- API endpoint testing
- Authentication flow validation
- Cross-module integration testing
- Database migration verification
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Phase 5: Documentation (~10,000 tokens)
- API documentation updates
- Employee workflow documentation
- Admin and vendor guides
- Database schema documentation

## Implementation Strategy

### Advantages of Current Codebase:
✅ Employee table structure exists
✅ Vendor-employee relationship established
✅ Booking assignment field ready
✅ Authentication patterns established
✅ File upload system ready
✅ Notification infrastructure available

### Key Implementation Areas:
1. **Employee Authentication System**
2. **Booking Assignment Logic**
3. **Status Management Workflow**
4. **Role-Based Access Control**
5. **Employee Dashboard Interface**

## Expected Outcomes:
- Complete employee management system
- Seamless booking assignment workflow
- Enhanced admin and vendor capabilities
- Improved service delivery tracking
- Better resource allocation and management

## Timeline: 2-3 hours total development time
## Token Estimate: 200,000 tokens
